Problem for "cant push refs to remote. try running "pull" first to integrate your changes"

1. Try git pull origin main

if this shows
fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

type git remote -v then git remote add origin <your-repo-url> 
for example: git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

then type git pull origin main

If this shows after adding the remote 

$ git pull origin main
From https://github.com/iamdevreyson/slidnetsystemphilcorp
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
 * [new branch]      main       -> origin/main
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories

Type
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

and after that commit the files you get from GitHub then try to push it again 


HOW TO PULL CHANGES MADE FROM OTHER DEVICES THAT HAVE BEEN SENT TO GITHUB REPO?
1. type git pull
if that doesn't work
2. type git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main
